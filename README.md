# Langmuirprobedataanalysis
Langmuir probes are ubiquitously used for insitu measurements of plasma parameters.These probes have been placed on many different platforms, including experimenta lsounding rockets for measurements in mesosphere-lower-thermosphere,and also on board satellites to obtain dataset soveran extended period of time in the ionosphere.
Ourwork confirms that mNLP instrument shows great promise,but also cautions in its data processing algorithms which can easily lead to 50% errors unless appropriately dealt with.Wethen present an ew way to analyze mNLP data that can bring theme asurement error to with in 10%
